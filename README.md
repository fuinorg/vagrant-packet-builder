# vagrant-packet-builder
[Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) script to build remotely a Vagrant base box or virtual machine (VM).

This is done using [packet.net](https://www.packet.net/) a baremetal cloud provider. Finally a base box is uploaded to Vagrant Cloud or a virtual machine (VM) is uploaded to a file storage like Artifactory.

## Prepare your environment
This section describes the steps that are necessary to run this [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) script locally. You need to execute them only once.

1. Install python and [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) packages on your local system
   ```
   sudo -H pip install packet-python ansible
   ```
2. Clone this repository and change into it
   ```
   git clone git@github.com:fuinorg/vagrant-packet-builder.git
   cd vagrant-packet-builder
   ```
3. Generate a new SSH key for packet.net
   ```
   mkdir .ssh
   ssh-keygen -f .ssh/id_rsa
   ```
4. Add the newly generated public key to packet.net
   * Goto "packet.net / Personal Profile / SSH keys" and press "Add Key"
   * Copy the content of ".ssh/id_rsa.pub" into field "Key", give it a nice "Title" and check "Select all devices"
